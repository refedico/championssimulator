# Champions League 2024 Group Stage Simulation

This repository contains a Python script that simulates the group stage of the 2024 Champions League. The competition format involves 36 teams, each playing 8 matches against different opponents.

Key features:

    - Each team is assigned a strength coefficient based on their real-world performance, which influences the outcome of simulated matches.
    - The simulation generates random results for each match, taking into account the relative strength of the teams.
    - The final standings are calculated based on points, goal difference, and other statistics, just like in the real Champions League.
    - After 10000 simulations, the average number of points required to finish in the top 8 is 16.21 points.

Feel free to modify the code to extract additional insights or explore different scenarios. This project offers a fun way to simulate the tournament and analyze potential outcomes!
